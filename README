A collection of short solutions for compressing CSS data.

Why? Because I searched for a simple and portable offline solution
and couldn't find anything suitable.

If you like to organize your style sheets in many files and use
some kind of synchronization process (rsync, Makefile, etc.), you
need a compressor that fits into that chain.

Of course there are compression libraries in web frameworks, but
since style sheets are mostly static, compression can be done
before uploading.
